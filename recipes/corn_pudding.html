    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The classic Jiffy corn casserole recipe first appeared on the back of the little blue Jiffy box, but curious home cooks have since riffed on the idea. Some versions call for heavy cream, while others call for more eggs for a souffl√©-like effect. There are even some packed with cheese! This six-ingredient Jiffy Corn Casserole recipe is the one to remember.</p>
